			<h4>Question 1: What challenges or troubles did you have 
				completing this assignment. How did you solve them?</h4>
				<p>I never had enjoyable working experience with 
					GitHub. I looked through the instruction from course
					material and even find the documents in Chinese. 
					There are way too many function for GitHub, which is
					useful for a large group of programmers, but a bit
					too confuse for me.
					Hopefully I can get it this time.</p></aside>
				<aside class="boxshadow dark-rose-bg">
			<h4>Question 2: What did you learn from this assignment? 
				What did you already know?</h4>
				<p>Basically all the skills needed here is 
					already known for me. Except for the GitHub part.
					GitHub seems a very useful tool if I can 
					get it right. While I was learning HTML and CSS
					I found a lot of people their work on GitHub and 
					some cool project is not limited to Computer Science.
					Really wish I can use GitHub well and share my 
					work as well. </p></aside>
				<aside class="boxshadow redbean-bg">
			<h4>Question 3: What resources (e.g. specific web articles, 
				the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in 
				completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h4>
				<p>I checked Piazza before starts to work, because 
					classmates mostly have similar problems I would 
					face. Comparing to start assignment without 
					expectation and preparation of problems is not 
					a smart way to learn.</p><p>W3C's Unified Validator is
					another tool recommended by my 195 instructor. By 
					pasting the link of website this validator can tell 
					me which line of my code got problem.</p><p>class 
					material simply offers all the starting up information 
					that is needed for everyone. It is always good to 
					look through to making sure I got all the details. 
					I didn't talk to any TA yet, but will do so in the future.</p></aside>
