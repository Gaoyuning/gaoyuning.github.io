        <h4>OSU email address:</h4>
			<p>gaoyu@oregonstate.edu</p>
        <h4>Major and year of study: </h4>
			<p>Major: Psychology - senior<p>
			<p>Minor: Computer Science and Marketing - senior<p>
        <h4>Question 1: On a scale from 0 (I've never seen HTML code) 
			to 10 (You know Facebook? I wrote that.), how confident 
			are you in your web development skills?</h4>
			<p>I'd say around 2 to 4, I took CS195 last term and built 
				a <a href = "http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~gaoyu/about/">resume</a> 
				and a 
				<a href = "http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~gaoyu/oregon-state-martial-arts-alliance/">website</a>
				that I'm proud to show off of. I learned 
				something about CSS and HTML and enjoyed to create 
				fun effect on my website with them.</p>
        <h4>Question 2: What do you hope to learn from this class?</h4>
			<p>I want to learn more programming languages and more 
				techniques to build a website. I used to take Usability 
				Engineering (CS 352) and Software Engineering courses 
				(CS 361 & cs362). I feel the skills I learned from 
				those courses are very valuable and inspirational. 
				I'm considering to get a maser's degree in either 
				UX/UI design or software development. 
				So, I hope I can improve my web development skills 
				and find out the right path for my future.</p>
        <h4>Question 3: Have you signed up for Piazza?</h4>
			<p>Yes, I signed up for Piazza. I used this for 
				other courses, never been active on it though.</p>
        <h4>A description of the most interesting fact about 
			you or the most unique experience you've had. Include 
			only what you can think of and write down in 
			two minutes, maximum:</h4>
			<p>I used to taking care of 6 cats in my apartment in 
				a summer vacation. 
				I had 3 cat litter box and 8 food bowls for them
				to prevent them from fighting with each other. 
				</p><p>Another summer, I was taking care of 2 dogs, 3 cats, 2 
				hamsters and 1  chinchilla. I kept hamsters and 
				chinchilla in a separate room and dogs mostly resting
				in their huge cage after walk. So cats became the freest
				souls in the apartment. My cat Teddy is a huge foodie, 
				he tasted dog food and hamster food, decided 
				dog food is the best in the apartment. </p>
